UICatalog
=========
 
This sample is a catalog exhibiting many views and controls in the UIKit framework, along with their various properties and styles.
If you need RubyMotion code to create specific UI controls or views, refer to this sample and it should give you a good head start in building your user interface.
In most cases you can simply copy and paste the code snippets you need. 
When images or custom views are used, accessibility code has been added. Using the iOS Accessibility API enhances the user experience of VoiceOver users.
 
 
Build Requirements
iOS 7.0 SDK or later
 
 
Runtime Requirements
iOS 7.0 or later, Automatic Reference Counting (ARC)
 
 
Using the Sample
Build and run the sample using iOS 7.0 SDK and RubyMotion version 2.19 or later.
To run in the simulator, set the Active SDK to Simulator. To run on a device, set the Active SDK to the appropriate Device setting.
 
In most areas of this sample, as you see various UI elements, you will see a corresponding explanation as to where you can find the code. 
So for example the Alerts page - there will be a label that identifies the source file for the Alert code e.g. rc_alerts_view_controller.rb".
This means refer to the rc_alerts_view_controller.rb
